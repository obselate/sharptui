# Yoga.Net provenance

- Upstream: https://github.com/chenrensong/Yoga.Net
- Pinned commit: `baf14fcd6cbf21d8930a297e32ef3b76674c37bd`
- Yoga.Net version: 3.2.3
- Meta Yoga behavior baseline: v3.2.1

## Goo-local patches

- Skip event payload construction when no subscriber exists.
- Intern `StyleLength` values in `StyleValuePool`.
- Reuse bounded, recursion-safe flex scratch lists.
- Track whether a style contains percentage lengths and invalidate cached layout
  when its owner width or height changes.

The vendored tree contains only the source needed to build Goo. Focused Goo tests
cover the local behavior changes; upstream Yoga tests remain in the upstream
repository at the pinned revision.
